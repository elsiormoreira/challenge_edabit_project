"""
Create a function that takes three number arguments â€” one number as an input
and two additional numbers representing the endpoints of a closed range â€” and
return the number limited to this range.

- If the number falls within the range, the number should be returned.
- If the number is less than the lower limit of the range, the lower limit
  should be returned.
- If the number is greater than the upper limit of the range, the upper limit
  should be returned.
